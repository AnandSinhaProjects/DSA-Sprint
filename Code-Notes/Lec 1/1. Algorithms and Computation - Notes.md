# 1. Algorithms and Computation - Notes

+ > **How to use this template**

   > This *Class Notes* template is a great place to capture all the main points from a class or lecture. Having in-depth notes can make it easier to complete assignments and prepare for exams, as well as being a handy way to identify gaps in your learning.

   > You can also easily share this page with classmates by using [ðŸ”— Share via Web](https://support.craft.do/hc/en-us/articles/4413266374673-Sharing-Documents).

+ > **Tips on how to create your Class notes**

   > When taking class notes, it is important to include key learnings, questions, resources and actions.

   > Key learnings are the most important points you learn in a class. They should be concise and easy to understand.

   > Questions should be specific and relevant to the class. They should help you to better understand the material.

   > Resources are any materials that help you to learn the material covered in class. This can include books, websites, articles, etc.

   > Actions are specific things you can do to apply what you have learned. They should be realistic and achievable.

## Key learnings :

The goal of this class is to teach you to solve computation problems, and to communicate that your solutions are correct and efficient.

- Binary relation from problem inputs to correct outputs
- Provide a verifiable predicate (a property) that correct outputs must satisfy

### Algorithms :

- Procedure of mapping each input to a single output.
- An algorithm is said to have a correct value if and only if it returns the correct value for each of the inputs provided.
- Taking an example for writing an Algorithm -
   - Maintain a record of names and birthdays (initially empty)
   - Interview each student in some order -
      - If the birthday exists in the record, return found pair!
      - Else add name and birthday to record.
   - Return None if the last student is interviewed without any success.

### Correctness :

- If the inputs are too small, we can use case analysis,
- But if the inputs are large, algorithms must be recursive or loop in some way.
- Hence to prove this we must use induction to first solve it on the base case and then draw generalisation.
- For Example - Proof of correctness of birthday matching algorithm
   - Induct on k: the number of students in record.
   - Hypothesis: If first k contain match, returns match before interviewing student k+1
   - Base Case - k = 0, first k contains no match
   - Assume that hypothesis holds true for k = k', and consider k = k'+1.
   - Now here there are two options with us:
      - If first k' contains a match, already returned the match by induction
      - Else if first k' do not have a match, then we will move to k' +1 has match, match contains k' + 1.
   - Then algorithm checks directly whether birthday of student k' +1 exists in the first k'.

### Efficiency :

- Efficiency is not just about how fast the algorithm is it is also about how it compares to the other alternative solutions of the problem.
- But this might pose a problem because as long as this is the case we have the limitation of the fact that the computation power of different systems are different.
- Hence a problem might have different run times on say a i3 and a i7. Hence we use the fixed-time operations algorithm takes to return.
- This is why we devised the asymptotic notations.
- Which are - Upper bounds (O), lower bounds (Î©), tight bounds (Î˜) âˆˆ, =, is, order
- These are the times estimated based on one operation per cycle on a 1 Ghz single core machine.
